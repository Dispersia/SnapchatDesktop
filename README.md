# SnapchatDesktop
Creating a desktop client for Snapchat, because why not.

SnapchatDesktop aims to be a fully featured client for desktop machines. It will allow you to do everything that you can currently do on the mobile version; access, add and remove friends, chat, send snaps via webcam and more to come!


> This project has and still is just a learning experience, but if you can find a use for it- feel free to fork away! Please note that the code may be sloppy at times, but currently I'm just trying to get everything together.

It had more, but it met its untimely demise on the new version of Snapchat, but it just shows I can get it to login as long as I hard-code the access key.
