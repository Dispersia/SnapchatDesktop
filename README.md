# SnapchatDesktop
 Creating a desktop client for snapchat, because why not.

 Creating a fully featured Snapchat client for desktop, that will allow you to do things such as access your friends, chat,
 and even use your webcam to send snaps to your friends! Just doing it for a learning experience but if you can find a use
 for it have at it :P. It'll be sloppy for a bit, but....,
 I'm just trying to get everything together.
 
 ya... only have login screen done lol.

 It had more, but it met its untimely demise on the new version of snapchat, but it just shows I can get it to login as long as I hardcode the access key.
